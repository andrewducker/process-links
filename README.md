# process-links
Processing links from Pinboard to find the most used ones.

Powershell script, and links from my own Pinboard.  Extracts all of the tags, and produces a list of all of them, in order of number of times it's been used.

To use, download your own XML file from https://pinboard.in/settings/backup and put it in the same folder as the script, then run process-links on it.

(The script is Powershell.  Which you can now use on Windows, Linux, and Mac.)
